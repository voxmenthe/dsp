[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)
# Exercise 4 Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are
# lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohenâ€™s d to quantify the difference 
# between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?

>> On average, first babies are somewhat lighter, with a mean weight of 7.2 lbs vs. a mean weight of 7.33 for the "others" group. The effect size is not very large, with Cohen's d showing .088 standard deviations versus .029 for the difference in pregnancy length, and as compared to 1.7 standard devs. for a height difference between men and women. On a more simplistic measure, as a fraction of the typical infant weigth, the difference in means is 1.7%, again slightly larger than 0.2% for the difference in pregnancy length between first and other babies. The effect size is larger, but still not massive.
